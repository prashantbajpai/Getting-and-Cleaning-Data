#Data Description

**label**

Activity label type

* 1 -  WALKING
* 2 - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* 3 - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* 4 - SITTING
* 5 - STANDING

**subject.id**

Id of subjects that took part in the study. Ranges from 1-30 for 30 subjects

**tBodyAcc-XYZ**

t denotes time domain signals which were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Accelaration was measured in standard gravity units 'g'. These are the set of varibles that were estimated:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

**tBodyGyro-XYZ**

t denotes time domain signals which were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Angular velocity was measured in radians per sec. These are the set of varibles that were estimated:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.
